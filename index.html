        <p>I'm a student at the University of Minnesota Coding bootcamp. As you read this paragraph you will realize how incredibly witty and fun I am.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second paragraph is more about me being sophisticated and erudite. I am certainly not typing words as a placeholder until I can think of something better.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The third paragraph dials it back so recruiters understand that despite my perfection I am still a person. Despite my razor wit and godlike aesthetics I do suffer the occassional hangnail, and have been known to sit up late at night and eat brownie chocolate chip icecream by the pint while wishing I didn't have to get up in the morning. Etcetera, Etcetera.</p>
